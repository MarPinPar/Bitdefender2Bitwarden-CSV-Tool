# Bitdefender2Bitwarden-CSV-Tool

This code is only designed for accounts ("login"). If you wish to import more types of items, "modelType" (row[0]) has to change to whatever matches in the Bitwarden naming conventions.

The csv structure may change in the future, make sure to check the current structure of both platforms before using this tool. Good thing is that is really easy to adapt!.
